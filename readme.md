## Project brief

Digital business card, where i was trying to improve my frontend skills. Working with CSS and HTML only. Simple animation is added to central image so it tilts on mouse over. While looking for a simple and fun projects to keep my focus on learning i have found it to be just that, simple and fun to do. Would be good to improve the animation and allow for user input to make it more interactive.

### Requirements

- Create a full-page background with a centered card layout.
- Add a user contact section on the left of the card with email, phone, and clickable social icons.
- Add a user image in the center of the card.
- Add a user info section on the right of the card with name, position, location, description, and technologies.
- Implement absolute-positioned shapes to improve the layout.
